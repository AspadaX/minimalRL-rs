# minimalRL-rs

A Rust implementation of [minimalRL](https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL), basic reinforcement learning with minimal codes. The Rust implementation is based on Burn and CPU. 

Hopefully, this repo can inspire more people to use Rust in the AI field. 

## Progress

I implemented PPO. Other implementations are on the way. 

I am still exploring reinforcement learning. If you would like to add other algorithms, please feel free to make a PR!
