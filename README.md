# minimalRL-rs

A Rust implementation of [minimalRL](https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL), basic reinforcement learning with minimal codes. The Rust implementation is based on [Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) and CPU. 

Hopefully, this repo can inspire more people to use Rust in the AI field. 

## Progress

- [X] Merged DQN into the main branch on Aug 25th, 2025

Other implementations are on the way. 

I am still exploring reinforcement learning. If you would like to add other algorithms, please feel free to make a PR! 

## Implemented Algorithm

- PPO
- DQN
